I'm seeking out opportunities to collaborate with companies / agencies / individuals, not just work for them. I want to bring my collective design experience to the table where we can work together to solve real business-problems in a way that optimizes all of our respective experience and knowledge.

            <p>
I want to avoid subjective pissing-matches, and favor open-minded collaborators where egos are out of the equation. 
If that all sounds about right, then lets for sure chat about how we can work together.
