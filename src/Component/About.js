<p>
    I'm Bipin Parajuli. I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer.

My primary focus is on building Front End Web Applications from a sketch.

My skillsets include languages like JavaScript, Java, CSS3, HTML5, C together with frameworks like React JS, Node JS,express and Bootstrap.

I do this because I love the process of turning dreams into reality by converting ideas into code. I have a serious passion for designing the top-grade UIâ€™s with working logic to create a dynamic user experience.

I have spent the past two years learning top-notch technologies and enhancing my skill sets. I have developed a couple of real-world projects during my learning phase as I love project-based learning.

Recently I'm a student of Bachelor Of Computer Application at Xavier International College.

On a side note, I love playing cricket and learning new technologies every day. It is something that allows me to be creative, connect with people.
