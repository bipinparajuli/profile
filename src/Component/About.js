<p>
     I am a JavaScript Developer 

who focus on frontend-framework react. I have a passion for Design System, Web Accessibility and Serverless technologies such as AWS.

To grow my skills I focus on building a JAM (Javascript, API's Mark Up) stack application.

</p>

<p>

I have a hands on experience on different programming languages like php, Java, C together with frameworks like Node JS,express and Bootstrap.

I do this because I love the process of turning dreams into reality by converting ideas into code. I have a serious passion for designing the top-grade UIâ€™s with working logic to create a dynamic user experience.

I have spent the past two years learning top-notch technologies and enhancing my skill sets. I have developed a couple of real-world projects during my learning phase as I love project-based learning.

Recently I'm a student of Bachelor Of Computer Application at Xavier International College.

On a side note, I love playing cricket and learning new technologies every day. It is something that allows me to be creative, connect with people.
